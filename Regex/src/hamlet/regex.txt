Stand, ho!
Holla, Bernardo!
See, it stalks away!
Speak, speak!
Lo, where it comes again!
I'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion!
If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
    Which happily foreknowing may avoid,
    O, speak!
Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!
Time be thine,
    And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
[aside] A little more than kin, and less than kind!
O that this too too solid flesh would melt,
    Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew!
How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable
    Seem to me all the uses of this world!
ah, fie!
Why, she would hang on him
    As if increase of appetite had grown
    By what it fed on; and yet, within a month-
    Let me not think on't!
Frailty, thy name is woman!-
    A little month, or ere those shoes were old
    With which she followed my poor father's body
    Like Niobe, all tears- why she, even she
    (O God!
O, most wicked speed, to post
    With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
But break my heart, for I must hold my tongue!
Thrift, thrift, Horatio!
Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
    Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!
O, yes, my lord!
O, fear me not!
Aboard, aboard, for shame!
Marry, well bethought!
Marry, I will teach you!
Go to, go to!
Ay, springes to catch woodcocks!
Look, my lord, it comes!
No, by no means!
Do not, my lord!
By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!-
    I say, away!- Go on.
Alas, poor ghost!
List, list, O, list!
Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
    With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts-
    O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power
    So to seduce!- won to his shameful lust
    The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen.
O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there,
    From me, whose love was of that dignity
    That it went hand in hand even with the vow
    I made to her in marriage, and to decline
    Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor  
    To those of mine!
O, horrible!
O, horrible!
Adieu, adieu, adieu!
Hold, hold, my heart!
Yes, by heaven!
O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
Now to my word:
    It is 'Adieu, adieu!
(within) My lord, my lord!
Illo, ho, ho, my lord!
Hillo, ho, ho, boy!
O, wonderful!
Not I, my lord, by heaven!
Why, right!
Well said, old mole!
O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
Rest, rest, perturbed spirit!
By the mass, I was about to say something!
At 'closes in the consequence'- Ay, marry!
God b' wi' ye, fare ye well!
O my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!
Ay, amen!
O, speak of that!
He is far
    gone, far gone!
[to Polonius] God save you, sir!
Ah,
    Rosencrantz!
Come, come!
the
    beauty of the world, the paragon of animals!
Your hands, come!
Well be with you, gentlemen!
Hark you, Guildenstern- and you too- at each ear a hearer!
Buzz, buzz!
O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!
Out, out, thou strumpet Fortune!
All you gods,  
      In general synod take away her power;
      Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,
      And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,
      As low as to the fiends!
God's bodykins, man, much better!
Ay, so, God b' wi' ye!
Yet I,
    A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak
    Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,  
    And can say nothing!
'Swounds, I should take it!
Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!
O, vengeance!
Why, what an ass am I!
This is most brave,
    That I, the son of a dear father murther'd,
    Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,
    Must (like a whore) unpack my heart with words
    And fall a-cursing like a very drab,
    A scullion!
About, my brain!
[aside] O, 'tis too true!
To sleep- perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub!
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,  
    And thus the native hue of resolution
    Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
    And enterprises of great pith and moment
    With this regard their currents turn awry
    And lose the name of action.- Soft you now!
The fair Ophelia!- Nymph, in thy orisons
    Be all my sins rememb'red.
No, not I!
Ha, ha!
O, help him, you sweet heavens!
O heavenly powers, restore him!
Go to, I'll no more on't!
O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!
The courtier's, scholar's, soldier's, eye, tongue, sword,
    Th' expectancy and rose of the fair state,
    The glass of fashion and the mould of form,
    Th' observ'd of all observers- quite, quite down!
O, woe is me
    T' have seen what I have seen, see what I see!
O, reform it altogether!
What, ho, Horatio!
O, my dear lord!
[to the King] O, ho!
O God, your only jig-maker!
But, by'r Lady, he must build churches then; or else
    shall he suffer not thinking on, with the hobby-horse, whose  
    epitaph is 'For O, for O, the hobby-horse is forgot!'

               Hautboys play.
You are naught, you are naught!
O, confound the rest!
[aside] Wormwood, wormwood!
Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light,
      Sport and repose lock from me day and night,
      To desperation turn my trust and hope,
      An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope,
      Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
      Meet what I would have well, and it destroy,
      Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife,
      If, once a widow, ever I be wife!
No, no!
Pox, leave
    thy damnable faces, and begin!
Lights, lights, lights!
O good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for a thousand
    pound!
Come, some music!
Come, the recorders!
Come, some music!
Therefore no more, but to the matter!
O wonderful son, that can so stonish a mother!
And do still, by these pickers and stealers!
O, the recorders!
Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me!
God bless you, sir!
My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites-
    How in my words somever she be shent,
    To give them seals never, my soul, consent!
O, my offence is rank, it smells to heaven;
    It hath the primal eldest curse upon't,
    A brother's murther!
O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,
    Art more engag'd!
Help, angels!
Bow, stubborn knees; and heart with strings of steel,
    Be soft as sinews of the new-born babe!
Why, this is hire and salary, not revenge!
(within) Mother, mother, mother!
No, by the rood, not so!
You are the Queen, your husband's brother's wife,
    And (would it were not so!) you are my mother.
Help, help, ho!
[behind] What, ho!
help, help, help!
Dead for a ducat, dead!
[behind] O, I am slain!
O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!
[Lifts up the arras and sees Polonius.]
    Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!
O, such a deed
    As from the body of contraction plucks  
    The very soul, and sweet religion makes
    A rhapsody of words!
O Hamlet, speak no more!
Nay, but to live
    In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,
    Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love
    Over the nasty sty!
O, speak to me no more!
No more, sweet Hamlet!
A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
    Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings;
    A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,
    That from a shelf the precious diadem stole
    And put it in his pocket!
A king of shreds and patches!-
    Save me and hover o'er me with your wings,
    You heavenly guards!
Alas, he's mad!
O, say!
O gentle son,
    Upon the beat and flame of thy distemper
    Sprinkle cool patience!
On him, on him!
Why, look you there!
My father, in his habit as he liv'd!
Alack,
    I had forgot!
[Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]
    Ah, mine own lord, what have I seen to-night!
In his lawless fit
    Behind the arras hearing something stir,
    Whips out his rapier, cries 'A rat, a rat!'
    And in this brainish apprehension kills
    The unseen good old man.
O Gertrude, come away!
Ho, Guildenstern!
[So haply slander-]
    Whose whisper o'er the world's diameter,
    As level as the cannon to his blank,
    Transports his poisoned shot- may miss our name
    And hit the woundless air.- O, come away!
Ho, Guildenstern!
Alas, alas!
But come, for England!
Come, for England!
O, from this time forth,
    My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!
O, ho!
Alas, look here, my lord!
Well, God dild you!
Indeed, la, without an oath, I'll make an end on't!
[Sings] By Gis and by Saint Charity,  
              Alack, and fie for shame!
Come, my coach!
The rabble call him lord;
    And, as the world were now but to begin,
    Antiquity forgot, custom not known,
    The ratifiers and props of every word,
    They cry 'Choose we!
Laertes shall be king!'
    Caps, hands, and tongues applaud it to the clouds,
    'Laertes shall be king!
O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs!
No, let's come in!
We will, we will!
[Exeunt his Followers.]
    O thou vile king,
    Give me my father!
I'll not be juggled with:
    To hell, allegiance!
vows, to the blackest devil
    Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!
My will, not all the world!
O heat, dry up my brains!
Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!
Fare you well, my dove!
You must sing 'A-down a-down, and you call him a-down-a.' O,
    how the wheel becomes it!
O, you must wear your rue with a difference!
'Naked!'
    And in a postscript here, he says 'alone.'
    Can you advise me?
Nay, but hear you, Goodman Delver!
Why, there thou say'st!
Come, my spade!
To't again, come!
Marry, now I can tell!
How the
    knave jowls it to the ground,as if 'twere Cain's jawbone, that
    did the first murther!
Or of a courtier, which could say 'Good morrow, sweet lord!
Why, e'en so!
[Takes the skull.] Alas, poor Yorick!
To what base uses we may return, Horatio!
O, that that earth which kept the world in awe
    Should patch a wall t' expel the winter's flaw!
O, treble woe
    Fall ten times treble on that cursed head
    Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense
    Depriv'd thee of!
Hamlet, Hamlet!
For love of God, forbear him!
And if thou prate of mountains, let them throw
    Millions of acres on us, till our ground,
    Singeing his pate against the burning zone,
    Make Ossa like a wart!
Hear you, sir!
Remember it, my lord!
Up from my cabin,
    My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark
    Grop'd I to find out them; had my desire,
    Finger'd their packet, and in fine withdrew
    To mine own room again; making so bold  
    (My fears forgetting manners) to unseal
    Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio
    (O royal knavery!), an exact command,
    Larded with many several sorts of reasons,
    Importing Denmark's health, and England's too,
    With, hoo!
Why, man, they did make love to this employment!
Why, what a king is this!
Well, again!
Come for the third, Laertes!
Look to the Queen there, ho!
No, no!
the drink, the drink!
The drink, the drink!
O, yet defend me, friends!
Here, thou incestuous, murd'rous, damned Dane,
    Drink off this potion!
Mine and my father's death come not upon thee,
    Nor thine on me!
Wretched queen, adieu!
O good Horatio, what a wounded name
    (Things standing thus unknown) shall live behind me!
O, I die, Horatio!
Good night, sweet prince,
    And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!
